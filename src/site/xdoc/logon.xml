    <section name="The input">
      <p>Language:
      <br/>
      If your local language is supported by yawebmail (and your browser is
      configured for this language), it should have been already selected.
      Otherwise select a language of you choice.</p>

      <p>Mailbox-Server:
      <br/>
      The server (host) where your Mailbox (POP3- or IMAP-Account) is located.
      If you don't know the hostname of your Mailbox please ask your
      eMail-account-provider.</p>

      <p>Mailbox-Protocol:
      <br/>
      Select if your eMail-account is accessible via
      <a href="glossary.html#pop3">POP3</a>,
      <a href="glossary.html#imap">IMAP</a>,
      <a href="glossary.html#pop3s">POP3/SSL</a> or
      <a href="glossary.html#imaps">IMAP/SSL</a> (some accounts support multiple
      protocols). If you're not sure, try POP3 first, then IMAP - or ask your
      eMail-account-provider.
      <br/>
      If you would like to log into a Google&#8482; Mail accout, try POP3 (SSL).
      </p>

      <p>Jaw-wrench-icon:
      <br/>
      Click the jaw-wrench-icon if you would like to specify a custom
      server-port to connect to (do this only if your eMail-account-provider
      told you so).</p>

      <p>Mailbox-Username:
      <br/>
      The username of your eMail-account. If you don't know the username of your
      Mailbox please ask your eMail-account-provider.</p>

      <p>Mailbox-Password:
      <br/>
      The password of your eMail-account. If you don't know the password of your
      Mailbox please ask your eMail-account-provider.</p>

      <p>Message-arrangement:
      <br/>
      This setting affects the arrangement of the message-listing(s).
      <br/>
      "All messages on one page" causes yawebmail to build one message-listing
      for all messages in a particular message-folder. This may result in a
      longer waiting period if you have a large amount of messages in your
      folder(s), since all message-headers have to be loaded.
      <br/>
      "Multiple pages (disables sorting)" causes yawebmail to split the content
      of your message-folder(s) to multiple message-listings (message 1 - 25,
      message 26 - 50, etc.). This feature disables an overall message-sorting
      since only the message-headers needed for a particular message-listing are
      loaded (and hence cannot be compared to the message-headers which are not
      loaded). The amount of messages per message-listing is defined by the
      yawebmail-admin (default: 25).
